# sickastley-dots

these are my dot files, i don't think these matter to you much. or do they? this is nothing but showoff that i know how to use arch linux with i3wm, you are an idiot because you use ubuntu. i could have clearly used a local usb drive to store these dots because that would be far more convinient, or just ade this repository private, but i didn't and will not, because i want to show the world that i use arch linux with i3wm.

## btw, i use arch.
